A compiled package to design peptide binders using experimentally solved protein complex structure.

*NOT SUITABLE TO RUN ON PRODUCTION SERVER (Optimization Required)*

For Cloning a Repository Refer to 
  https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository 

-> Goto the <> Code Tab for Cloning Repository 

  Method 1

       python app.py  
-> By default application will run on the development server at 127.0.0.1:5000

Remark: Please be aware that the current iteration of this tool is tailored exclusively for designing peptides targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Extending its applicability to other proteins is currently in progress. 

To test the pipeline described in the paper, kindly upload the provided pbds files located in the Peplide_Demofiles directory.

Special thanks to Chirag Nawale for compiling the scripts into this user-friendly tool :)
