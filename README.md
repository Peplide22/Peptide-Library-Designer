Remark: Please be aware that the current iteration of this tool is tailored exclusively for designing peptides targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Extending its applicability to other proteins is currently in progress. 

To test the pipeline described in the paper, kindly upload the provided pbd files located in the Peplide_Demofiles directory.

Special thanks to Chirag Nawale for compiling the scripts into this user-friendly tool :)
